            <p>We have relationships with third parties who may receive personal information directly from the cookies placed by our Web Site on your computer to assist in analyzing our business and customers.</p>
            <p>Our Web Site also uses a common web technology called &quot;action tags&quot; (also called single pixel gifs or web beacons) to anonymously track purchase, usage and other web activity information. Action tags (including third party tags) may be used to provide data to third parties for tracking purposes. However, our Web Site does not use action tags to collect or transfer personal information.</p>
            <h4>How we use the information we collect?</h4>
            <p>We use information we collect to communicate with you, to process your orders, to provide an enhanced and more personalized shopping experience, to inform you and your gift and message recipients of offers and discounts from Gigalumi and our affiliated brands and to enable you to receive credits for purchases under loyalty or buying programs which you have joined. In addition, we may make such information (except for credit card number and expiration date, unless you consent otherwise), including aggregated information, available to selected third parties including, but not limited to, those who share or rent information for direct marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>However, without your consent, we do not make your, or your gift or message recipients&#39; email addresses, available to third parties. In addition, you may instruct that other personal information about you or your message or gift recipients&#39; that you have provided to us not be shared with third parties by following the instructions in <em>How to Limit the Use of Personal Information</em>, below.</p>
            <p>Our Affiliates, subcontractors, and agents, and any successors to our business (if we ever sell some or all of our business), are <em>not</em> considered to be third parties under this Policy. However, in connection with information collected under this Policy, they are required to comply with this Policy. &quot;Affiliates&quot; are persons or entities directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Gigalumi.</p>

            <h4><strong>Information about Interest-Based Advertisements</strong></h4>
            <p>We serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of Third Parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
            <p>We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Through the DAA and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, ads that are customized based a consumer’s online behavior across different websites and properties. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt-out pages.</p>

By using the Web Site or otherwise providing us with information, you hereby consent to this transfer.</p>
            <p>In addition, if you submit data to us about other individuals (such as your message and gift recipients), you agree that you have obtained consent from each such individual to the submission, transfer and processing of the information. Although personal information collected by us through the Web Site, emails, mail, fax, and telephone is used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy, laws generally applicable to the protection of personal data in the U.S. may not be as stringent as those in other countries.</p>
            <h4>Links to Other Web Sites</h4>
            <p>Gigalumi wants you to be aware that when you click on links and/or ad banners that take you to affiliated or third-party web sites, you will be subject to the privacy policies and <a href="/terms-conditions/" target="_blank"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a> of those web sites, not ours.

            <h4>Security and Passwords</h4>
            <p>If you place an order on our Web site, it encrypts the credit card number you submit prior to transmission over the Internet using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology. This technology works best when the Web Site is viewed using Microsoft&#39;s Internet Explorer® or Netscape Navigator®.

Although we make reasonable efforts to safeguard personal information once we receive it, we cannot warrant the security of information we receive.</p>
            <p>Portions of the Web Site (such as our Member registration and Address Book) may require registration and log-in processes in which you will select a user ID and password (collectively, the &quot;Password&quot;). Passwords provided to you by us are the confidential property of the Company and may be used by you solely for your individual use of the Web Site (and otherwise as specified by us). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any Password and for all activities that occur using your Password, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Password or accounts.</p>
